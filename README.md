# Jamie Barton's Dotfiles
Here are my dotfiles. You'll find many customisations here for Zsh, Vim and Git.

# Setup
You must be using [Dotfiles](http://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) by
[Thoughtbot](http://gihub.com/thoughtbot) to get started with these dotfiles. I
hope to break this into it's own repo using their open-source dotfile management
tool [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).
